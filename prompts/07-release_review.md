### Testing
Review:

- Backend unit tests
- Frontend unit tests
- Test coverage
- CI test execution

Verify that:

### AI Project Memory
Review all AI project files and verify that:

- Long-term context reflects the current implementation
- Session handoff accurately describes the current project state
- Completed work has been removed from outstanding tasks
- Remaining work is clearly identified

## Deliverables
Provide a release report containing:

1. Release Readiness Assessment

State whether the project is Ready for Release, Ready with Minor Issues, or Not Ready for Release. Explain the reasoning.

2. Executive Summary

Summarize the overall health of the release.

3. Release Checklist

Summarize the status of features, documentation, testing, build, CI/CD, security, Docker, versioning, and AI project memory.

4. Remaining Risks

Identify issues that could impact users after release and classify each as Critical, High, Medium, or Low.

5. Recommended Release Notes

Summarize new features, improvements, bug fixes, breaking changes, and known limitations.

6. Follow-up Work

List work that should be completed after the release and prioritize it as High, Medium, or Low.

Base your assessment on the current state of the repository.
Do not implement changes.
Only produce the release readiness report.
